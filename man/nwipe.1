.SH NAME
nwipe \- securely erase disks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nwipe
[\fIoptions\fR] [\fIdevice1\fR] [\fIdevice2\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
nwipe is a command that will securely erase disks using a variety of
recognised methods.  It is a fork of the dwipe command used by Darik's Boot
and Nuke (dban).  nwipe is included with partedmagic if you want a quick and
easy bootable CD version.  nwipe was created out of a need to run the DBAN
dwipe command outside of DBAN, in order to allow its use with any host
distribution, thus giving better hardware support.  It is essentially the
same as dwipe, with a few changes:
.TP
- pthreads is used instead of fork
.TP
- The parted library is used to detect drives
.TP
- The code is designed to be compiled with gcc
.TP
- SIGUSR1 can be used to log the stats of the current wipe
